🎙️ Speech-to-Text Transcription

This project demonstrates how to convert speech from an audio file into text using Python and the `SpeechRecognition` library.

✅ Built as part of my Artificial Intelligence internship at **Codec Technology**.

📌 Features
- Transcribes `.wav` audio files into text
- Uses Google Speech Recognition API
- Supports multiple audio files
- Simple and beginner-friendly implementation

💻 Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- SpeechRecognition
- PyAudio

🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
```bash                                                                                                                                                             
git clone https://github.com/your-username/speech-to-text-transcription.git

2. Install dependencies:

pip install SpeechRecognition
pip install pyaudio  # Use pipwin if this fails

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook and replace 'yourfile.wav' with your own .wav file path.
